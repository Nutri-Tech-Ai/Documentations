 TRL 1 - Basic Principles Observed and Reported  

 Questions and Answers:

❌ Rough calculations support the concept?  
Not yet. No formal calculations have been done to validate the feasibility of AI-driven crop recommendations or disease detection in NutriTech’s context. we’re relying on general AI research in agriculture, but we haven’t run actual tests or simulations.  

❌ Has the concept been discussed or published in scientific literature, journals, or academic papers?  
No. Nothing has been written or published about NutriTech. we’re working off existing research in AI and agriculture but haven’t contributed anything original yet.  

⚠ Are the experiments exploratory in nature, focusing on understanding the basic science rather than practical applications?  
Partially. The AI model research is exploratory, but since there’s no dataset collection or field testing yet, it's more conceptual than experimental.  

✅ Is the technology in a nascent stage, with no clear pathway to application or commercialization?  
Yes, but we do have a rough idea of where we're headed (AI-driven recommendations + market integration). However, the "how" part is still vague.  

⚠ Are there significant unknowns or uncertainties in how the technology might evolve or be used?  
Yes. we don’t know if farmers will adopt it, how accurate our AI models will be, or how we’ll integrate sensors and data collection.  

❌ Are there any research papers, technical reports, or patents documenting the basic principles or observations?  
No, not for NutriTech. we’re basing our work on existing agricultural AI research, but there’s no NutriTech-specific study.  

⚠ Is there a focus on purely theoretical or experimental work rather than practical design or engineering?  
Right now, it’s more theoretical than practical. our AI models and sensors are just concepts—there’s no working prototype.  

❌ Has no effort been made yet to develop hardware, software, or systems for practical implementation?  
Correct. No actual development has started, aside from discussions and research. No working AI model, no backend, no hardware prototype.  

⚠ Scientific research has begun to be translated into applied research and development?  
Very early-stage. we’ve done secondary research but haven’t started our own applied research.  

✅ The basic scientific principle or phenomenon supporting this technology been observed or identified?  
Yes, AI and ML work in agriculture, but we haven't proven that our specific approach works.  

✅ Basic principles (physical, chemical, mathematical) support the concept?  
Yes. AI models, soil science, and weather impact on crops are well-documented areas of study.  

✅ Is this technology idea derived from fundamental research, such as physics, chemistry, biology, or materials science?  
Yes. It’s based on agronomy, AI, and data science.  

❌ Is there any foundational research or theoretical study that explains the underlying science of the technology?  
Not specifically for NutriTech. we’re pulling research from various places, but there’s no unified theoretical paper backing our exact approach.  

❌ Is the concept disconnected from any specific industrial or commercial application at this stage?  
No. we’re targeting farmers, but we haven’t validated market demand.  

⚠ Are there no clear end-users, industries, or markets identified for this technology yet?  
we have identified them (farmers, agri-businesses), but no real engagement has happened yet to confirm they actually need this.  

⚠ A scientific / technology development methodology or approach been developed?  
Not properly. we have ideas but no structured methodology or workflow in place.
